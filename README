key encrypted LSB steganography PNG album filesystem in user space

Create, access, and modify a key encrypted LSB steganography filesystem in user space using a directory of PNG images.  Filesystem state is only preserved after safely closing the filesystem via unmount or Ctrl+C.  A filesystem may only use images with the same dimensions as the root image provided.

A filesystem requires a name, key, root image, and storage images.  To access a filesystem the correct key, filesystem name, and root image must be given.  All data is XOR'd with the SHA512 hash of the key as it is read and written from the images.  The root image stores the filesystem name, consumed and total space, image and file count, image hashs, and file meta data.  All images added to the filesystem while formatting or expanding are found in the same directory as the root image.

Formatting a filesystem wipes each available least significant bit in the images provided, similarly removing a file wipes its data and shifts the filesystem if there is a hole.  All files in the filesystem have permissions of 644 and cannot be edited, but can be read, renamed, deleted, and copied.


DEPENDENCIES:
	- libfuse-dev
	- libpng12-dev
	- libssl-dev
	- pkg-config


COMPILE:
	- make all
	- sudo make install


KNOWN BUGS:
	- Filesystem does not support  directories


COMMANDS:
       -format
              create a new filesystem using valid images in directory of root image provided and mount it.

       -expand
              expand  and mount an existing filesystem. The directory containing the root image is scanned for additional valid PNG images not already included in the filesystem.

       -mount
              mount an existing filesystem

       -debug
	      enable bit by bit debug output. IO blocking from this output will cause the filesystem to operate very slowly.

       -help  
	      echo command syntax and exit program.


EXAMPLES:
       albumfs -format images/vacation/image.png

       albumfs -debug -mount images/vacation/image.png


TODO:
	- Use different way to write to root image so offset can be unsigned
	- Support directories
	- Add option for live updating
